This folder contains all code related to efforts to Dedupe raw datasets using Python's Dedupe library. 
In addition to a test folder containing sample Dedupe inputs and outputs run on sets of artist names 
as a proof of concept (along with scripts to map results of Dedupe to raw data), there exists test
folders housing all the code needed to ssh into and run dedupe in a user-friendly format on a remote server.
